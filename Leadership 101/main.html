        <p>It is simple, the higher your leadership skills are the more efficient you are. Right out of the gate the author states that he starts his conferences going over his Law of the Lid. 
        Becuase your leadership level has an impact directly, and indirectly on those that you are leading. From there the story jumps to two brothers named Dick, and Maurice. Perhaps you know them
        better as the McDonald brothers. You know the golden arches McDonalds brothers. It lays out the brothers' success and failures. Using the law of the lid princaple the author guages their ranking on this law of the lid
        scale. Even with all their success he states they are better managers than leaders. </p>
